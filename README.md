Memory-Game is a simple but addictive card matching game. The aim of the game is to find all pairs of cards by remembering their location and associating them with each other.

## Rules of Memory Game
- _**Game Goal:**_
  - Finding all pairs of cards by matching them together
- _**Starting the game:**_
  - All cards are placed face down on the board
  - The player starts the game by revealing two cards in one move
- _**Matching cards:**_
  - If two revealed cards are identical (form a pair), they remain uncovered on the board, and the player gets an additional turn
  - If the cards do not match, they are covered again, and the player tries again in the subsequent moves
- _**End of the game:**_
  - The game ends when all pairs of cards are found
- _**The randomness of the card arrangement:**_
  - The arrangement of cards is generated randomly, making the game diverse and challenging
